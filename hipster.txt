A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, 
after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric 
precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents 
and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable 
mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department 
that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place. (IEEE Grid newsmagazine) 
In C++ it’s harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but when you do, you blow off your whole leg. 
(Bjarne Stroustrup) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. 
(Anonymous) Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been 
written by someone else. (Eagleson’s Law) Microsoft has a new version out, Windows XP, which according to everybody 
is the ‘most reliable Windows ever.’ 
To me, this is like saying that asparagus is ‘the most articulate vegetable ever.’ (Dave Barry)
